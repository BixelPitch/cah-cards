## TL;DR
I found a lot of implementations of the beloved card game "Cards against humanity", but they lack of quantity and quality of the card packs - Especially when it comes to non-english versions of the game. This repository aims to be the #1 resource when implementing a Cards against Humanity game. Feel free to raise issues, questions and PR's ðŸ˜Š
